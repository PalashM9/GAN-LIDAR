## Overview
This project contains a trial of generative AI models, focusing on the development and training of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The repository includes a Jupyter notebook with the implementation of the training pipeline, model definitions, and utility functions required to generate and denoise images.

## Features
- GAN model implementation for image generation.
- Training pipeline for both generator and discriminator models.
- Utility functions for image pre-processing and denoising.
- Model saving and loading mechanisms.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV (for image operations)
- Matplotlib (for plotting training progress)
- NumPy
